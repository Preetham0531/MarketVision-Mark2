## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-Horizon Forecasting**: Delivers predictions for multiple timeframes: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, catering to both short-term traders and long-term investors.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Utilizes a powerful **LightGBM** model for both regression (price forecasting) and classification (trend direction), trained on a rich, high-dimensional dataset.
- **Holistic Data Analysis**: Integrates a wide array of data sources for a 360-degree market view:
  - **Price & Technical Data**: Over 40 technical indicators calculated from historical price data.
  - **News Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time news analysis using a pre-trained **FinBERT** model to gauge market sentiment.
  - **Fundamental & Macro Data**: Incorporates company fundamentals and global market indices (NIFTY, S&P 500, VIX) for broader context.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly Streamlit application that visualizes data, predictions, and model insights in an accessible format.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides transparency by showing the top factors (e.g., RSI, news sentiment) that influenced each prediction.
- **Risk Assessment**: Offers dynamic Stop-Loss and Take-Profit recommendations based on predicted volatility to help manage risk.

## 🛠️ How It Works: Architecture & Dataflow

MarketVision operates on a sophisticated pipeline that transforms raw data into actionable predictions. The entire process, from data collection to visualization, is automated and modular.

</p>

1.  **Data Collection**: The system fetches historical price data, global indices, and company fundamentals from `yfinance`, while news articles are scraped from Google News RSS feeds.
2.  **Feature Engineering**:
    -   **Technical Indicators**: Over 40 indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands are computed using `pandas-ta`.
    -   **Sentiment Analysis**: News headlines and summaries are processed by a FinBERT model to generate sentiment scores.
    -   **Macro Context**: Features like Beta (vs. NIFTY 50) and sector performance are calculated to place the stock in the context of the broader market.
3.  **Model Training**: The engineered features are used to train a `MultiOutput` LightGBM model. This model learns the complex relationships between the features and future price movements, allowing it to predict multiple targets (e.g., price, trend, volatility) simultaneously.
4.  **Live Prediction & Interface**: For real-time predictions, the application fetches the latest market data, runs it through the feature engineering pipeline, and feeds the result to the trained model. The output is then beautifully rendered in the Streamlit dashboard.
